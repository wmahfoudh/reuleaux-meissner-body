## Reuleaux Tetrahedron
The Reuleaux tetrahedron is the intersection of four balls of radius s centered at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. The Reuleaux tetrahedron has the same face structure as a regular tetrahedron, but with curved faces: four vertices, and four curved faces, connected by six circular-arc edges.

## Meissner Tetrahedra
Because the Reuleaux tetrahedron is not a surface of a constant width like the triangle Releaux on a 2D surface, Ernst Meissner and Friedrich Schilling showed how to modify the Reuleaux tetrahedron to form a surface of constant width, by replacing three of its edge arcs by curved patches formed as the surfaces of rotation of a circular arc. It has been also conjectured that the Meissner tetrahedra has the smallest possible volume for a constant surface shape, but this has not been mathematically demonstrated (yet ðŸ˜‰).
