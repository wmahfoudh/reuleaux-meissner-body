A 3D model of both, the Reuleaux tetrahedron and Meissner body in STEP and STL formats

## Let's start in 2D: the Reuleaux Triangle
The Reuleaux tetrahedron and the Meissner tetrahedra are both three-dimensional shapes that are related to the Reuleaux triangle, a two-dimensional curve of constant width.

When rotated, a disk will keep its centre fixed, while the Reuleaux triangel will have its centre of gravity rotating on a circular path.

This is an interesting property that is used to for example to drill square holes:

## Now in 3D: The Reuleaux Tetrahedron
The Reuleaux tetrahedron is the intersection of four balls centered at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. It has the same face structure as a regular tetrahedron, but with curved faces: four vertices, and four curved faces, connected by six circular-arc edges.

## Meissner Tetrahedra
Because the Reuleaux tetrahedron is not a surface of a constant width like the triangle Releaux on a 2D surface, Ernst Meissner and Friedrich Schilling showed how to modify the Reuleaux tetrahedron to form a surface of constant width, by replacing three of its edge arcs by curved patches formed as the surfaces of rotation of a circular arc. It is conjectured that the Meissner tetrahedra have the smallest volume among all solids of constant width, but this has not been mathematically demonstrated (yet ðŸ˜‰).
